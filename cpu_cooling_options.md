# CPU Cooler solutions for the Supermicro X10SLE-F

Officially the cpu cooler for a X10SLE-F is a very low profile and proprietary [SNK-P0047PSR](https://store.supermicro.com/1u-passive-proprietary-cpu-cooler-snk-p0047psr.html), 
as well as the 
It makes totally sense for Supermicro to recommend only one heat sink, since it needs to fit exactly the small blade, when used in a micro cloud chassis. 
However, since we are trying to use it as a single board and maybe with a custom case, we should figure out alternatives to this cooler. 

## Dimensions of the physical connection to the Board

Screw Distances:
Short side: 56mm 
Long side: 94mm 

This looks very similar to the typcial Supermicro socket 2011 narrow ILM! Thats pretty awesome as we have a broader selection of cooling solutions.
